# Server (Disabled)

This `server/` directory has been disabled as part of converting the repository to a client-only React SPA.

If you want to restore or keep the server, you can remove or rename this file. To fully remove the server from the repo, tell me and I will delete the `server/` folder and remove server-related dependencies from `package.json`.

Notes:
- Dev/start/build scripts now use Vite (see root `package.json`).
- Server files are kept for reference and can be deleted if you confirm.
